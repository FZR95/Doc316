## 推荐的扩展插件

### C/C++ Intellisense 

IntelliSense is a general term for various code editing features including:

•*code completion*

•*parameter info*

•*quick info*

•*member lists*

IntelliSense features are sometimes called by other names such as "code completion", "content assist", and "code hinting.“

VS Code supports word-based completions for any programming language but can also be configured to have richer IntelliSense by installing a language extension.
